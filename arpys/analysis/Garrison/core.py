"""
This core class will define methods and properties that are generically useful to all analysis packages, e.g. MDC class,
which will all subclass this core class; so that we do not have to rewrite these methods, etc. For example, selecting a
cropped region to use for fitting will be generically useful to MDC and EDC fitting. However, do note that we should not
repeat properties or methods that are defined in arpes class, which will have an extention for MDC and other analysis
classes all future analysis packages that subclass core.
